# Anki REST Helper

This is my personal Anki helper. I use it to generate/enrich my Anki notes.

It interacts with Anki using REST API exposed via [AnkiConnect plugin](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect). 

# Features

- automatic text-to-speech generation using Microsoft Azure transcription 
  for multiple note fields.
